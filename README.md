# Scouting FRC
Scouting FRC is a project aimed to make scouting more universal for all teams. 
Making scouting applications is time consuming and arduous process. We hope this
will make scouting easier for teams and allow teams to focus on the robot,
instead of a custom scouting app.

## Getting Started
Download the files, and run them on a website.

## Testing the website
If there are any issues while testing the website, git back to us by putting an
issue in [Github](https://github.com/RSchneyer/scoutingfrc/issues)

## Contributing
We would love to have all the help we can in building and testing this website!
