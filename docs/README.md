# ScoutingFRC
ScoutingFRC is a progressive web app (PWA) aimed to make scouting more universal for all teams. 
Making scouting applications is time consuming and arduous process. We hope this
will make scouting easier for teams and allow teams to focus on the robot,
instead of a custom scouting solution.
